## Privacy & Accessibility

### Privacy Guarantees

#### Whisper Well - Complete Privacy
The Whisper Well is a **symbolic ritual only**. Your privacy is guaranteed:
- ✅ **Nothing is saved** - Text is never stored to localStorage, IndexedDB, or any storage mechanism
- ✅ **Nothing is sent** - No network requests are made. Text never leaves your device.
- ✅ **Nothing is viewable** - Text is read directly from the input field for animation only, then immediately cleared
- ✅ **No logging** - Text is not logged to console or any debugging tools
- ⚠️ **Do not enter personal or sensitive data** - While technically private, this is a symbolic feature for cathartic release

**How it works**: When you click "Release", the text is read from the DOM, used to create temporary animation elements, and the input is immediately cleared. The text variable goes out of scope after the animation, ensuring no persistence.

#### Mood Tracker - Local Storage Only
Your mood data is **stored on this device only**:
- 📱 **Device-only storage** - Uses IndexedDB (with localStorage fallback) in your browser
- 🔒 **No cloud sync** - Data never leaves your device
- 🚫 **No analytics** - We don't track, analyze, or transmit your mood data
- 💾 **Export control** - You can export your data as CSV at any time
- 🗑️ **Delete control** - Clear all mood data with one click in the Mood Tracker page

#### Tasks & Focus Sessions
All task and focus session data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. No data is transmitted to any server.

### Accessibility Features

#### How to Disable Animations
If animations cause discomfort or distraction:
1. Navigate to **Settings** (press `7` or click the settings icon)
2. Toggle **"Animations"** to OFF
3. All decorative animations will be disabled while maintaining functionality
4. Your preference is saved and persists across sessions

The app also automatically respects your system's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.

#### How to Disable Sound
To silence all audio in the application:
1. Click the **mute toggle** button in the navigation bar (available on all pages)
2. Or navigate to **Settings** and toggle **"Sound"** to OFF

4. Your mute preference is saved and persists across sessions
